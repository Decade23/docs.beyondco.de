# Remote Mailboxes

Remote mailboxes in HELO allow you to test your live and staging application as easily as local application emails.
A remote mailbox in HELO gives you a valid email address that you can use to send emails to. HELO will periodically check if your mailbox has an incoming email and display it in the HELO application.

## Creating remote mailboxes

To get started, you can create your first remote mailbox, by pressing the "Create new remote mailbox" button.

Once your mailbox is created, HELO will show you a unique email address. Use this email address to send any emails to HELO. You can identify that HELO is checking a specific inbox, by looking at the HELO header.

## Receiving remote emails

As soon as HELO retrieves an email for the unique email address, it will be visible in the HELO application - just like local mailboxes.
